This web application uses laravel framework to achieve CMS style database application for storing experimental data recorded at NUS advanced robotics workshop2. The focus of DE team here is to explore the potential of using dielectri elastomer as actuator and generator. I started this application to support organizing data.
Also, the announcement system in this app allows the team members to plan and share their works.  The outsider can only visit the static pages modified by team members using this app whereas the team can use it as a database after login
